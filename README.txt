==HTML5 Canvas-based flash games!
Here we make a multiplayer online clone of angry birds.
The idea is to use the magic of nowjs, box2d, and akihabara
to create an angry birds game that matches up to 6 players
in a free-for-all bird / pig / etc. throwing contest to 
knock down each other's castles. 

In addition, we build in, using the INGIDIO api, game-shops
coin stores, and all the other goodies we said we would put
into this thing.
